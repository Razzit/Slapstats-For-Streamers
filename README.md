# SlapStats-For-Streamers
A Python script that grabs stats from your latest Slapshot custom match and outputs the values to a text file

Instructions:
1.) Place the exe or script into your Slapshot matches folder "..\steamapps\common\SlapshotRebound\Slapshot_Data\Matches"
2.) Run the exe or script.
3.) 2 files will be generated in the same directory - home_stats.txt and away_stats.txt
4.) The program will continue to monitor the files and update stats until you exit with CTRL + C.
4.) Use these generated .txt files to populate your stream overlay

Format of the txt files:
Goals
Shots
Saves
Faceoff percentage
Takeaways
Passes
Possession Time

Notes:
Use either the supplied .exe file or manually compile the python script.
For the exe, you will likely have to add an exception to your Anti-Virus to run it.
