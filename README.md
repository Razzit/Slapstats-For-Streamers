# SlapStats For Streamers
A Python script that grabs stats from your latest Slapshot custom match and outputs the values to a text file.

Instructions:  
1.) Place the exe or script into your Slapshot matches folder "..\steamapps\common\SlapshotRebound\Slapshot_Data\Matches".  
2.) Run the exe or script - see 'Notes'.  
3.) 2 files will be generated in the same directory - home_stats.txt and away_stats.txt.  
4.) SlapStats will continue to monitor the files and update stats until you exit with CTRL + C or close the window.  
5.) Use the generated .txt files to populate your stream overlay.  

Format of the txt file values in order:  
Goals  
Shots  
Saves  
Faceoff percentage  
Takeaways  
Passes  
Possession Time  

Notes:  
Use either the supplied .exe file or download python and execute the script (https://www.python.org/downloads/).  
For the exe, you will likely have to add an exception to your Anti-Virus to run it.
